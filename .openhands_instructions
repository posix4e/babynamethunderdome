# Repository Overview

This repository contains Baby Name Thunderdome, a application that helps parents choose baby names through collaborative voting. The application allows:
- Parents to input and manage their preferred baby names
- Friends and family to participate in name selection through a simple voting interface
- Since none of the data is private, the authentication model should be about making it easy to share links instead of a ton of usernames and passwords
- it's a simple python program and you can learn more about it by reading the github actions
